# Potiential masking & workflow  
* Co-register MNI152 (1mm) to JLF sub-atlases  
* Create a multi-label MNI mask  
  * Cortical GM  (FreeSurfer, HCP derived)  
    * May want to separate Insula
  * Thalamus (Morel)
  * Basal Ganglia (Harvard-Oxford or some other method)  
  * Cerebellum (SUIT)  
  * Brainstem, Pons, Medulla, etc.  
  * Leftover regions (mostly WM, anything else?)  
* Create a slightly smoothed version (soft edges) for use after func processing  
* Warp labels to JLF sub-atlases, hand-edit (only have to do once)  
* Multi-atlas JLF to subject anatomical (vote on/decide winner)  
* Register anatomical to MNI, use JLF masks for cost-functioning  
* Register mean func with anat, combine with anat to atlas  
* Clip func by MNI-space JLF mask (or possibly subejct specific mask now in MNI space)  
* Process regions independenetly  
* Re-clip func processed pieces by smoothed JLF mask, recombine  
* Concatenate all func runs, demean, div by stdev, scale, etc. 
* Post-processing  





# fMRI Motion Correction  
 ## Background  
 * Conclusions will be drawn from intensity values, derived from greyscale values across time    
 * If voxels are misaligned, incorrect conclusions (or no conclusions at all) might be made  
 * An exaggerated example  
 
  ![ExampleEPIMotion](https://github.com/brussj/nimg_core/blob/master/pipelines/motionCorrectionExample.png)  
 
 ## antsMotionCorr (vs. 3dvolreg)  
 * More control over motion correction parameters (nonlinear over affine, more iterations, etc.)  
 * Ability to sum motion correction parameters into other registrations (EPI blip-up/blip-down, b0 to T1, T1 to MNI, etc.)  
 
 ### 3dvolreg (AFNI) vs. ANTs  
 * EPI run has 168 timepoints.  Use halway point as target for motion correction (but made a mistake and used 64, not 84)  
   * For testing, this won't matter.  For real-world, this would matter (kinda, sorta)  
 * For simplicity, used the collapsed average output from vanilla run of 3d volreg  
 * Ran the affine version for use with applying the motion correction to the data  
   * Could have calculated the motion parameter estimates (rotations and translations) from the Affine info but just re-ran with a rigid-body (6 paramter) version and logged the MOCO data

 * At first glance, everything looks wrong with antsMotionCorr.  
   * AFNi uses mm for translations, degrees for rotations, under the assumption that near the edge of the brain that 1 deg ~= 1mm.  ANTs appears to use radians.
   * Quickly converted between from radians to degrees via:
```  
Deg = Rad*180/3.14159  
```  
 * One problem solved  
  
 ![afniAntsMotionCorrDeg](https://github.com/brussj/nimg_core/blob/master/pipelines/AFNI_ANTs_motParams_ANTsDeg.png)  
 
 * Pulled apart the rotations and translations to visually compare one at a time  
 * It looks like AFNI and ANTs have a different order and a few differing directions  
 
 ![afniAntsMotionCorrSplit](https://github.com/brussj/nimg_core/blob/master/pipelines/AFNI_ANTs_RotationsTranslations_base.png)  

 * From the man page of 3dvolreg  
```  
The output is in 9 ASCII formatted columns:  
n  roll  pitch  yaw  dS  dL  dP  rmsold rmsnew  
```  
 * The orginal mapping to antsMotionCorr  
```
rot1 rot2 rot3 trans1 trans2 trans3  
```
 * The new mappign to antsMotionCorr to match 3dvolreg  
```
-rot3 -rot1 -rot2 trans3 trans1 -trans2  
```  

 ![afniAntsMotionCorrSplitReordered](https://github.com/brussj/nimg_core/blob/master/pipelines/AFNI_ANTs_RotationsTranslations_FlippedSwapped.png)  
 
 * Putting this all back together, antsMotionCorr and 3dvolreg look to be quite similar  
![afniAntsMotionCorrFinal](https://github.com/brussj/nimg_core/blob/master/pipelines/AFNI_ANTs_motParams_ANTsDeg_FlippedSwapped.png)  

## Final thoughts
* For small scale motion, there are minimal differnces between antsMotionCorr and 3dvolreg.  For large motions (see ~TR 146), even with minimal settings, ANTs looks to do a better job in correcting that motion  
* Experiment with different parameters to antsMotionCorr  
  * More iterations, more sub-levels, differnt amounts of smoothing  
  * Possibly add a nonlinear component to handle larger motions and distortions  
* Rather than use the 6 motion parameters as nuisance regressors, look into Framewise Displacement
